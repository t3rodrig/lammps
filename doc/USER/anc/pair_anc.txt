[Description:]

The {anc/cut} styles compute the Approximate Non-Conformal (ANC) potential,
described in "(del Rio)"_#delRio and given by

:c,image(Eqs/pair_anc.jpg)

Rc is the cutoff.

Style {anc/cut/coul/cut} adds a Coulombic pairwise interaction given by

:c,image(Eqs/pair_coulomb.jpg)

where C is an energy-conversion constant, Qi and Qj are the charges on
the 2 atoms, and epsilon is the dielectric constant which can be set
by the "dielectric"_dielectric.html command.  If one cutoff is
specified in the pair_style command, it is used for both the ANC and
Coulombic terms.  If two cutoffs are specified, they are used as
cutoffs for the ANC and Coulombic terms respectively.

Styles {anc/cut/coul/long} compute the same
Coulombic interactions as style {anc/cut/coul/cut} except that an
additional damping factor is applied to the Coulombic term so it can
be used in conjunction with the "kspace_style"_kspace_style.html
command and its {ewald} or {pppm} option.  The Coulombic cutoff
specified for this style means that pairwise interactions within this
distance are computed directly; interactions outside that distance are
computed in reciprocal space.

Style {anc/cut/dipole/cut} computes interactions between pairs of particles
that each have a charge and/or a point dipole moment.  In addition to
the ANC interaction between the particles (Eanc) the
charge-charge (Eqq), charge-dipole (Eqp), and dipole-dipole (Epp)
interactions are computed by these formulas for the energy (E), force
(F), and torque (T) between particles I and J.

:c,image(Eqs/pair_anc_dipole2.jpg)
:c,image(Eqs/pair_anc_dipole3.jpg)

where qi and qj are the charges on the two particles, pi and pj are
the dipole moment vectors of the two particles, r is their separation
distance, and the vector r = Ri - Rj is the separation vector between
the two particles.  Note that Eqq and Fqq are simply Coulombic energy
and force, Fij = -Fji as symmetric forces, and Tij != -Tji since the
torques do not act symmetrically.  These formulas are discussed in
"(Allen)"_#Allen and in "(Toukmaji)"_#Toukmaji.

Style {anc/cut/dipole/long} computes long-range point-dipole
interactions as discussed in "(Toukmaji)"_#Toukmaji. Dipole-dipole,
dipole-charge, and charge-charge interactions are all supported, along
with the ANC interactions, which are computed
with a cutoff.  A "kspace_style"_kspace_style.html must be defined to
use this pair style.  Currently, only "kspace_style
ewald/disp"_kspace_style.html support long-range point-dipole
interactions.

Atoms with dipole moments should be integrated using the "fix
nve/sphere update dipole"_fix_nve_sphere.html command to rotate the
dipole moments.  The {omega} option on the "fix
langevin"_fix_langevin.html command can be used to thermostat the
rotational motion.  The "compute temp/sphere"_compute_temp_sphere.html
command can be used to monitor the temperature, since it includes
rotational degrees of freedom.  The "atom_style
dipole"_atom_style.html command should be used since it defines the
point dipoles and their rotational state.  The magnitude of the dipole
moment for each type of particle can be defined by the
"dipole"_dipole.html command or in the "Dipoles" section of the data
file read in by the "read_data"_read_data.html command.  Their initial
orientation can be defined by the "set dipole"_set.html command or in
the "Atoms" section of the data file.

For all of the {anc} pair styles, the following coefficients must
be defined for each pair of atoms types
via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the
examples above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands.

E0 (energy units)
r0 (distance units)
S0 (unitless)
cutoff1 (distance units)
cutoff2 (distance units) :ul

The latter 2 coefficients are optional.  If not specified, the global
ANC and Coulombic cutoffs specified in the pair_style command are used.
If only one cutoff is specified, it is used as the cutoff for both ANC
and Coulombic interactions for this type pair.  If both coefficients
are specified, they are used as the ANC and Coulombic cutoffs for this
type pair.  You cannot specify 2 cutoffs for style {ANC}, since it
has no Coulombic terms.

For {anc/cut/coul/long} only the ANC cutoff can be specified since a
Coulombic cutoff cannot be specified for an individual I,J type pair.
All type pairs use the same global Coulombic cutoff specified in the
pair_style command.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

These pair styles do not support mixing. Thus, coefficients for all
I,J pairs must be specified explicitly.

All of the {anc} pair styles supports the
"pair_modify"_pair_modify.html shift option for the energy of the pair
interaction.

The {anc/cut/coul/long} pair styles support the
"pair_modify"_pair_modify.html table option since they can tabulate
the short-range portion of the long-range Coulombic interaction.

All of the {anc} pair styles support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
tail option for adding a long-range tail correction to the energy and
pressure for the NM portion of the pair interaction.

All of the {anc} pair styles write their information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

All of the {anc} pair styles can only be used via the {pair} keyword of
the "run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  They do not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

These pair styles are part of the USER-ANC package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.
